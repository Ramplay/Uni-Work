My code should be able to run all, some, or no flags on either RR or FCFS.
When tested with the sample input, the same output is achieved.
There should be no errors except there may be a problem if there is no 
available process in the ready queue before every thread is terminated.
I believe I coded to prevent that breaking my program but it has not been
tested.
